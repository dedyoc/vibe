# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a real-time streaming data pipeline that ingests social media posts from Bluesky's firehose, processes them through a scalable streaming architecture, and detects trending topics using sliding time windows. The system is designed to handle high-volume social media data streams and provide real-time insights into emerging trends and patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to ingest real-time social media posts from Bluesky's firehose, so that I can analyze current social media trends and conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL connect to Bluesky's ATProto firehose
2. WHEN a new post is received from the firehose THEN the system SHALL extract post content, author, and timestamp
3. WHEN processing firehose messages THEN the system SHALL handle posts, likes, follows, and reposts events
4. WHEN the firehose connection is interrupted THEN the system SHALL automatically reconnect and resume from the last processed cursor
5. IF a malformed message is received THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing without crashing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to use Kafka as a message broker, so that I can decouple data ingestion from processing and ensure reliable message delivery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN posts are received from Bluesky THEN the system SHALL publish them to a Kafka topic
2. WHEN publishing to Kafka THEN the system SHALL partition messages by author DID for balanced processing
3. WHEN Kafka is unavailable THEN the producer SHALL retry with exponential backoff
4. WHEN messages are published THEN the system SHALL use structured serialization with JSON format for development and Avro for production
5. IF the Kafka cluster has multiple brokers THEN the system SHALL ensure message replication for fault tolerance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to process streaming data using Apache Flink, so that I can perform real-time windowed aggregations and trend detection at scale.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Flink jobs start THEN they SHALL consume messages from Kafka topics
2. WHEN processing posts THEN the system SHALL extract keywords and hashtags from post content
3. WHEN applying time windows THEN the system SHALL use sliding windows of configurable duration
4. WHEN calculating trends THEN the system SHALL count keyword frequencies within each time window
5. IF processing fails THEN Flink SHALL use checkpointing to recover from the last successful state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a trend analyst, I want to detect trending keywords and topics in real-time, so that I can identify emerging conversations and viral content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN keywords are extracted from posts THEN the system SHALL normalize them (lowercase, remove punctuation, filter stop words)
2. WHEN counting keyword frequencies THEN the system SHALL maintain sliding window statistics
3. WHEN a keyword frequency exceeds a threshold THEN the system SHALL mark it as trending
4. WHEN trends are detected THEN the system SHALL publish trend alerts to a separate Kafka topic
5. IF multiple keywords trend simultaneously THEN the system SHALL rank them by frequency and growth rate

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run the entire pipeline locally using Docker Compose, so that I can develop and test the system without complex infrastructure setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running docker-compose up THEN all required services SHALL start (Kafka, Zookeeper, Flink, producers)
2. WHEN services start THEN they SHALL automatically configure networking and dependencies
3. WHEN developing locally THEN code changes SHALL be reflected without rebuilding all containers
4. WHEN viewing logs THEN each service SHALL provide structured logging with appropriate log levels
5. IF a service fails THEN Docker Compose SHALL restart it automatically with proper health checks

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want to monitor pipeline performance and health, so that I can ensure the system is processing data efficiently and identify bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL expose metrics for message throughput and processing latency
2. WHEN Kafka topics have lag THEN the system SHALL alert on consumer lag exceeding thresholds
3. WHEN Flink jobs are processing THEN they SHALL report checkpoint duration and backpressure metrics
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them with correlation IDs for tracing
5. IF system resources are constrained THEN monitoring SHALL show CPU, memory, and network utilization
